Principal conclusion

The linkage between digitalization and the organization of work in the public sector has been conceptually formulated in the literature, however there is an notorious gap in the empirical approximation to this question. Several factors make this line of inquiry complex, the very nature of the public sector as a non-market, the absence of prices for outputs, data limitations and measurement challenges. Furthermore, public administrations are not homogeneous in scale nor scope, they respond to intricate institutional factors, path dependencies, socio-political arrangements, plus having economic and fiscal constraints. Nonetheless, the public sector is considered a large adopter of ICT technologies and commands a massive workforce, the empirical research on the issue is scant. This project aims to contribute to further understand the relationship between digitalization and public sector employment. The public sector vis-Ã -vis the business sector remains a relatively unexplored field as regards the effects of digitalization on the workforce. This paper presents an exploration of a dataset built by selecting and merging data from the World Bank's Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators (WWBI) and the United Nations' e-Government Development Index (EGDI) for 16 European countries between 2008 and 2018. Three variables were chosen to run the initial exploration, a country level variable: 1) public sector employment as share of paid employment; and at the occupational level : 2) professionals; 3) technicians. Descriptive evidence shows heterogeneities among countries and years for the selected variables. Initial analyses show a positive sign coefficient when regressing the EGDI on the variables 1 and 2. But negative and significant coefficient for variable 3.
